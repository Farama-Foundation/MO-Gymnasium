# MO-Gym: Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Environments

Gym environments for multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL). The environments follow the standard [gym's API](https://github.com/openai/gym), but return vectorized rewards as numpy arrays.

For details on multi-objective MDP's (MOMDP's) and other MORL definitions, see [A practical guide to multi-objective reinforcement learning and planning](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10458-022-09552-y).

## Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LucasAlegre/mo-gym.git
cd mo-gym
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```python
import gym
import mo_gym

env = mo_gym.make('minecart-v0') # It follows the original gym's API ...

obs = env.reset()
next_obs, vector_reward, done, info = env.step(your_agent.act(obs))  # but vector_reward is a numpy array!

# Optionally, you can scalarize the reward function with the LinearReward wrapper
env = mo_gym.LinearReward(env, weight=np.array([0.8, 0.2, 0.2]))
```

## Environments

| Env | Obs/Action spaces | Objectives | Description |

Treasures values taken from [Yang et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08342.pdf). |

Enemies have a 10% chance of killing the agent. From [Barret & Narayanan 2008](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1390156.1390162). |
|  `fruit-tree-v0` <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucasAlegre/mo-gym/main/screenshots/fruit-tree.png" width="200px"> | Discrete / Discrete |  `[nutri1, ..., nutri6]` | Full binary tree of depth d=5,6 or 7. Every leaf contains a fruit with a value for the nutrients Protein, Carbs, Fats, Vitamins, Minerals and Water. From [Yang et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.08342.pdf). |
|  `breakable-bottles-v0` <br><img src="" width="200px"> | Discrete (Dictionary) / Discrete |  `[time_penalty, bottles_delivered, potential]` | Gridworld with 5 cells. The agents must collect bottles from the source location and deliver to the destination. From [Vamplew et al. 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197621000336). |

|  `mo-mountaincar-v0` <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucasAlegre/mo-gym/main/screenshots/mo-mountaincar.png" width="200px"> | Continuous / Discrete |  `[time_penalty, reverse_penalty, forward_penalty]` | Classic Mountain Car env, but with extra penalties for the forward and reverse actions. From [Vamplew et al. 2011](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220343783_Empirical_evaluation_methods_for_multiobjective_reinforcement_learning_algorithms). |
| `mo-reacher-v0` <br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LucasAlegre/mo-gym/main/screenshots/reacher.png" width="200px">| Continuous / Discrete | `[target_1, target_2, target_3, target_4]` | Reacher robot from [PyBullet](https://github.com/benelot/pybullet-gym/blob/ec9e87459dd76d92fe3e59ee4417e5a665504f62/pybulletgym/envs/roboschool/robots/manipulators/reacher.py), but there are 4 different target positions. |
