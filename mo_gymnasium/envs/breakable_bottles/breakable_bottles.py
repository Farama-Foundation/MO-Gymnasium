    ## Description
    This environment implements the problems UnbreakableBottles and BreakableBottles defined in Section 4.1.2 of the paper
    [Potential-based multiobjective reinforcement learning approaches to low-impact agents for AI safety](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197621000336).

    ## Action Space
    The action space is a discrete space with 3 actions:
    - 0: move left
    - 1: move right
    - 2: pick up a bottle

    ## Observation Space
    The observation space is a dictionary with 4 keys:
    - location: the current location of the agent
    - bottles_carrying: the number of bottles the agent is currently carrying (0, 1 or 2)
    - bottles_delivered: the number of bottles the agent has delivered (0 or 1)
    - bottles_dropped: for each location, a boolean flag indicating if that location currently contains a bottle

    ## Reward Space
    The reward space has 3 dimensions:
    - time penalty: -1 for each time step
    - bottle reward: bottle_reward for each bottle delivered
    - potential: While carrying multiple bottles there is a small probability of dropping them. A potential-based penalty is applied for bottles left on the ground.

    ## Starting State
    The agent starts at location 0, carrying no bottles, having delivered no bottles and having dropped no bottles.

    ## Episode Termination
    The episode terminates when the agent has delivered 2 bottles.

    ## Arguments
    - size: the number of locations in the environment
    - prob_drop: the probability of dropping a bottle while carrying 2 bottles
    - time_penalty: the time penalty for each time step
    - bottle_reward: the reward for delivering a bottle
    - unbreakable_bottles: if True, a bottle which is dropped in a location can be picked up again (so the outcome of dropping a bottle is reversible),
    otherwise a dropped bottle cannot be picked up.

    ## Credits
    This environment was originally a contribution of Robert Klassert
